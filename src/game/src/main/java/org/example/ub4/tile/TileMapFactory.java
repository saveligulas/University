    Ideas:
    - Create a map of booleans first in a 2d array in which i define where the tiles will be
    - Check that the created map is possible, so no isolated tiles or tiles that are connected only diagonally
    - Read that map and check if there are places to place rooms, doors, interactions etc.
    - Then create the tile and id them correctly, then connect them in the right order
